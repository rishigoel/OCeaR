# OCeaR
Image to Speech app

This IOS app is written in swift.  The user takes a picture of text and presses the listen button.  The app will then parse out the text from the image and say it out loud.

Logistics:

- The OCR is done using the Tesseract API
- AVFoundation converts the text to speech
- Simple and easy to use UI
